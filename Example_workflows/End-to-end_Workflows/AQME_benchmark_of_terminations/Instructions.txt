2. Keep only the first 100 molecules, and remove a few molecules containing iodine (remaining 96 molecules)
3. Run the CSEARCH_RDKit_organics.ipynb notebook
4. Analyze results of the CSEARCH conformational sampling in CSEARCH-Data-Solub_DB.csv
5. Run the COM files generated in the Solub_DB --> com_files folder
6. Run the QCORR_Analysis_with_isomerization_check.ipynb notebook
7. Analyze results of the QCORR post-processing of QM files in QCORR-run_1-stats.csv
