1. Using conda-forge: "conda install -c conda-forge aqme"  
2. Using the code in GitHub: "pip install ." with setup.py (most updated version, recommended)  
2. Using pip: "pip install aqme"  
  
Requirements:  
  * When AQME is installed from pip, RDKit and Openbabelare required: "conda install -c conda-forge rdkit openbabel"  
  * If CMIN is used, torch-related modules are needed: "pip install torch torchvision torchani"  
  
Known incompatibilities:  
  * RDKit cannot be installed through "pip install rdkit" in Windows when Anaconda prompts are used
